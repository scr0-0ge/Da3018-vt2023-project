# Da3018-vt2023-project
Project: a genome assembly graph
Here is how you run the code:
1. javac GenomeAssemblyGraph.java
2. java -Xss1G -Xms25G GenomeAssemblyGraph 

Note1, you should change xms number into a number that your pc supports, I have 64gb ram so that why I can give it 25gb.
Note2, g.readData("G:\\project\\Da3018-vt2023-project\\Spruce_fingerprint_2017-03-10_16.48.olp.m4"); on line 58, you should change it into where your Spruce_fingerprint_2017-03-10_16.48.olp.m4 is at.
lets say your Spruce_fingerprint_2017-03-10_16.48.olp.m4 is inside programing folder at destop then it will be "C:\\Users\\your username\\Desktop\\programing\\Spruce_fingerprint_2017-03-10_16.48.olp.m4"
